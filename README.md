# dataframe-analyzer
A python class to create neural networks for analysis of dataframes, with examples.

Note the jupyter files don't contain proper analysis just examples of how the class can be used.

Originally I created a simpler version of this class as an excersise solver during a Data Science course at infoshareAcademy, thus the commit history is missing.

The following packages are required to run:
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn
tensorflow
